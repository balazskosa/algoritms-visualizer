  <h1>What is Tournament Sort?</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Tournament sort is a sorting algorithm.
      It improves upon the naive selection sort by using a priority queue to find the next element in the sort.
    </li>
    <li>
      Tournament sort is a variation of heapsort.
    </li>
    <li>
      Complete binary tree with n external nodes and n - 1 internal nodes.
    </li>
    <li>
      External nodes represent tournament
      players.
    </li>
    <li>
      Each internal node represents a match
      played between its two children;
      the winner of the match is stored at
      the internal node.
    </li>
    <li>
      Root has overall winner.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Selection sort Time Complexity</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      O(1) time to play match at each match node.
    </li>
    <li>
      O(n) time to initialize n player winner tree.
    </li>
    <li>
      Remove winner and replay. O(log n) time
    </li>
    <li>
      Remove winner and replay n times. O(n log n) time
    </li>
    <li>
      Worst-case performance O(n log n)
    </li>
    <li>
      Average performance O(n log n)
    </li>
  </ul>
