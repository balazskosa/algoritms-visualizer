<h1>What is Heap Sort algorithm?</h1>
<ul>
<li>Heap Sort is a popular and efficient sorting algorithm in computer programming. Learning how to write the heap sort algorithm requires knowledge of two types of data structures - arrays and trees.
<li>The initial set of numbers that we want to sort is stored in an array e.g. [10, 3, 76, 34, 23, 32] and after sorting, we get a sorted array [3,10,23,32,34,76].
<li>Heap sort works by visualizing the elements of the array as a special kind of complete binary tree called a heap.
<li>
</ul>

<h1>Relationship between Array Indexes and Tree Elements</h1>
<ul>
<li>A complete binary tree has an interesting property that we can use to find the children and parents of any node.
<li>If the index of any element in the array is i, the element in the index 2i+1 will become the left child and element in 2i+2 index will become the right child. Also, the parent of any element at index i is given by the lower bound of (i-1)/2.
<li>Understanding this mapping of array indexes to tree positions is critical to understanding how the Heap Data Structure works and how it is used to implement Heap Sort.
